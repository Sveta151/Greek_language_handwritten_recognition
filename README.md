# Greek_language_handwritten_recognition
This project aimed to create a neural network identifying handwritten text with the Greek alphabet.
### Project Motivation 
Handwriting recognition is proving to be a very popular neural network-related topic. However, nearly all handwriting recognition networks are limited to recognizing the Latin alphabet. My research found that there aren't many handwriting recognition networks that can recognize the Greek alphabet. Therefore, I propose creating a neural network identifying handwritten text with the Greek alphabet.
The Greek language is the official language of Greece, where it is spoken by 99% of the population, and one of the official languages of Cyprus where Greek Cypriots mostly use it. Only 0.18% of the worldâ€™s population speaks Greek. The map below shows countries with significant Greek populations and descendants (+1,000,000; +100,000; +10,000: +1,000).
